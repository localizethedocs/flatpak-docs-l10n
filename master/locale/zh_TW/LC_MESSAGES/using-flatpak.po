"``flatpak`` is the primary Flatpak command, to which specific commands are "

"install`` and the command to uninstall is ``flatpak uninstall``."

msgid "Identifiers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/using-flatpak.rst:24
msgid ""
"Flatpak identifies each application and runtime using a unique three-part "
"identifier, such as ``com.company.App``. The final segment of this address "
"is the object's name, and the preceding part identifies the developer, so "
"that the same developer can have multiple applications, like ``com.company."
"App1`` and ``com.company.App2``."

msgid "Identifier triples"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/using-flatpak.rst:33
msgid ""
"Typically it is sufficient to refer to objects using their ID. However, in "
"some situations it is necessary to refer to a specific version of an object, "
"or to a specific architecture. For example, some applications might be "
"available as a stable and a testing version, in which case it is necessary "
"to specify which one you want to install."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/using-flatpak.rst:39
msgid ""
"Flatpak allows architectures and versions to be specified using an object's "
"identifier triple. This takes the form of ``name/architecture/branch``, such "
"as ``com.company.App/i386/stable``. (Branch is the term used to refer to "
"versions of the same object.) The first part of the triple is the ID, the "
"second part is the architecture, and the third part is the branch."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/using-flatpak.rst:45
msgid ""
"Identifier triples can also be used to specify just the architecture or the "
"branch, by leaving part of the triple blank. For example, ``com.company.App//"
"stable`` would just specify the branch, and ``com.company.App/i386//`` just "
"specifies the architecture."

"Flatpak commands can be run either system-wide or per-user. Applications and "

"available to the users that installed them."

"The same principle applies to repositories - repositories that have been "

"can only be used by a particular user."

msgid ""
"Flatpak commands are run system-wide by default. If you are installing "
"applications for day-to-day usage, it is recommended to stick with this "
"default behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/using-flatpak.rst:69
msgid ""
"However, running commands per-user can be useful for testing and development "
"purposes, since objects that are installed in this way won't be available to "
"other users on the system. To do this, use the ``--user`` option, which can "
"be used in combination with most ``flatpak`` commands."
