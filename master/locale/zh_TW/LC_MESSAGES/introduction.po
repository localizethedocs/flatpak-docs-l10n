"Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications across various "
"Linux distributions. It was created by developers with a long history of "
"working on the Linux desktop and is run as an independent open source "
"project."

msgid "Terminology"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:11
msgid ""
"Flatpak: a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop "
"applications on Linux."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:12
msgid ""
"Flatpak application: an application installed via the ``flatpak`` command or "
"through a graphical interface, such as GNOME Software or KDE Discover."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:14
msgid ""
"Runtime: also called platform, an integrated environment providing basic "
"utilities needed for a Flatpak application to work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:16
msgid ""
"BaseApp: an integrated set of additional libraries and frameworks, such as "
"Electron, for Flatpak applications that need more than just the basic "
"runtime."
msgstr ""

"Flatpak bundle: a single-file export format containing a Flatpak application "
"or runtime."

msgid "Target audience"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:23
msgid ""
"Flatpak can be used by all kinds of desktop applications and aims to be as "
"agnostic as possible in terms of how applications are built. There are no "
"requirements regarding which programming languages, build tools, toolkits or "
"frameworks can be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:28
msgid ""
"While Flatpak only runs on Linux, it can be used by applications that target "
"other operating systems as well as those that are Linux-specific. "
"Applications can be open source or proprietary (although some distribution "
"services, like `Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, can have restrictions in "
"this respect)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:33
msgid ""
"Flatpak's only technical requirements are that applications follow a small "
"number of Freedesktop standards to enable desktop integration (see :doc:"
"`conventions`)."

msgid "Issues with the current packaging model"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:40
msgid ""
"It is important to understand the problems with the current model of "
"packaging applications to understand the existence of Flatpak:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:43
msgid ""
"**Fragmentation and duplicated work**: each Linux distribution has their own "
"package managers and package formats that are incompatible with each other. "
"This leads to a lot of fragmentation and duplicated work since the same "
"application needs to be packaged multiple times for various distributions. "
"Furthermore, developers either need to learn the format of every "
"distribution or support only a few. This makes the Linux desktop a difficult "
"platform for software vendors to target."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:49
msgid ""
"**Limited to apps that are packaged**: not every application is packaged for "
"every Linux distribution. If an application isn't packaged for a specific "
"distribution, users are left with limited and unreliable options, often "
"technical in nature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:52
msgid ""
"**Limited to distributions that have the apps**: users are limited to only "
"the distributions that have all the necessary applications for their "
"workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:54
msgid ""
"**Hard to innovate in OS space**: distribution maintainers spend a huge "
"amount of time and effort in packaging rather than focusing on improving "
"their distributions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:56
msgid ""
"**Old and outdated packages**: LTS distributions often have very old "
"versions of applications packaged. This complicates bug reproducibility or "
"leads to support requests for bugs that have been fixed upstream in newer "
"versions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:60
msgid ""
"Flatpak addresses these issues by enabling developers to distribute "
"applications from one source and target the entire Linux desktop."

msgid "Reasons to use Flatpak"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:66
msgid "Flatpak offers major advantages over most system package managers:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:68
msgid ""
"**Universality**: Flatpak allows applications to be installed and run on "
"virtually any Linux distribution, including non-GNU distributions, systemd-"
"free distributions, immutable distributions and various architectures "
"without requiring the developer to have access to the relevant hardware."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:72
msgid ""
"**Space for innovation**: Flatpak allows distribution maintainers to focus "
"on innovating their distribution without being burdened by packaging "
"concerns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:74
msgid ""
"**Stability**: breakages in Flatpak applications do not affect the system "
"since they run in isolated environments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:76
msgid ""
"**Rootless install**: Flatpak does not require elevated privileges to "
"install applications or runtimes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:78
msgid ""
"**Sandboxed applications**: one of Flatpak's main goals is to increase the "
"security of desktop systems. This is achieved by isolating applications from "
"one another and limiting their access to the host environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:82
msgid ""
"Flatpak also offers advantages over other universal approaches to Linux "
"application distribution:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:84
msgid ""
"**Decentralized by design**: Flatpak offers decentralized hosting and "
"distribution, allowing developers or downstreams to host their own "
"applications and application repositories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:87
msgid ""
"**Desktop integration**: Flatpak offers native integration with many Linux "
"desktop environments, allowing users to easily browse, install, run, and "
"manage Flatpak applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:89
msgid ""
"**Space efficiency**: Flatpak saves storage by deduplicating libraries and "
"other files used by multiple applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:91
msgid ""
"**Delta updates**: only updated data is downloaded during updates, saving "
"network bandwidth."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:93
msgid "Other benefits for developers include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:95
msgid ""
"**Forward-compatibility**: the same Flatpak application can run on different "
"versions of a distribution, including unreleased versions, without needing "
"any changes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:97
msgid ""
"**Bundling**: this allows application developers to ship almost any "
"dependency or library as part of their applications, giving them complete "
"control over their applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:100
msgid ""
"**Consistent application environments**: Flatpak provides a consistent and "
"identical application runtime environment across devices and distributions. "
"This makes bug identification and testing easier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:103
msgid ""
"**Branches**: this allows application developers to distribute multiple "
"branches of an application (e.g. ``stable``, ``beta``, etc.) while retaining "
"the same name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:105
msgid ""
"**Maintained platforms**: Flatpak runtimes contain a collection of common "
"dependencies for the applications to use, easing application development and "
"maintenance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:110
msgid ""
"In general, Flatpak is best suited for desktop applications. While command-"
"line applications also work, Flatpak may not be suitable in some cases:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:114
msgid ""
"The application needs to elevate privileges using ``su``, ``sudo``, "
"``pkexec``, etc. Flatpak cannot run SUID binaries inside the sandbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:116
msgid ""
"The application requires access to ``/proc`` on the host or unfiltered "
"access to processes. This is not allowed as Flatpak has a private ``proc``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:118
msgid ""
"The application uses a syscall blocklisted by Flatpak's seccomp filter. For "
"example, Flatpak won't allow spawning sub-namespaces in the sandbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:121
msgid ""
"Kernel modules or drivers are non-application packages and won't work as a "
"Flatpak."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:124
msgid ""
"In general, if the sandbox prohibits an application's core functionality or "
"becomes too inconvenient or obtrusive, Flatpak may not be the most suitable "
"packaging choice."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:128
msgid ""
"Flatpak also won't export udev rules or systemd services from the sandbox to "
"the host and requires manual configuration after installing the Flatpak "
"package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/introduction.rst:132
msgid ""
"Information about Flatpak's internals can be found in :doc:`under-the-hood`."
