"``flatpak-builder`` is the primary tool for building Flatpak applications. "
"It allows you to take the source files for an application and build it into "
"a Flatpak application. It also allows multiple other dependencies to be "
"built at the same time, which get bundled into the build."

"It is packaged by several distributions and there is also a `Flatpak package "

"The input to ``flatpak-builder`` is a manifest file. This specifies the "
"parameters for the application that will be built, such as its name and "
"which runtime it will depend on. The manifest also lists all the modules "
"that are to be built as part of the build process. A source for each module "
"can be specified, including links to file archives or version control "
"repositories. One of the modules (usually the last one) is the application "
"code itself."

"Where ``<build-dir>`` is the path to the directory that the application will "
"be built into, and ``<manifest>`` is the path to a manifest file. The "
"contents of ``<build-dir>`` can be useful for testing and debugging "
"purposes, but is generally treated as an artifact of the build process."

"SDKs are like the regular runtime that applications run in. The difference "

"files, compilers and debuggers."

"Each runtime has an accompanying SDK. For example, there is both a GNOME 43 "
