"Some aspects of repositories are addressed by other sections of the "
"documentation. Basic commands for adding, removing and inspecting "
"repositories can be found in the :doc:`using-flatpak` section. Additionally, "
"the section on :doc:`flatpak-builder` covers the most common method for "

"To use a repository to publish an application, it is possible to either host "
"your own (covered in the next section, :doc:`hosting-a-repository`) or use "
"`Flathub <https://flathub.org>`_, the primary publishing and hosting service "
"for Flatpak applications."

"Software center applications like GNOME Software or KDE Discover allow "
"browsing repositories, and can also dynamically promote new or popular "
"applications. If you use Flathub, the repository will typically have already "
"been added by users, so adding an application to the repository is "
"sufficient to make it available to them."

"One advantage of ``.flatpakref`` files is that they can be used to install "

"``.flatpakref`` can be used to install applications from the command line as "

msgid ""
"Flatpak repositories are similar to Git repositories, in that they store "
"every version of an application by keeping a record of the difference "
"between each version. This makes updating efficient, since only the "
"difference (or \"delta\") between two versions needs to be downloaded when "
"an update is performed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../docs/repositories.rst:82
msgid ""
"When a new version of an application is added to a repository, it "
"immediately becomes available to users. Software centers are able to "
"automatically check for and install new versions. Those who are using the "
"command line have to manually run ``flatpak update`` to check for and "
"install new versions of any applications they have installed."
